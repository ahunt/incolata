# 8020 / 8020A / 8020M stuff

## Components

(See also the Operation and Service Manual, below, it lists most of this stuff.
 There is also a list of suppliers at the bottom of this page.)

**Essentials, hard to find elsewhere:**

* The machine, including dust cap.
* Alcohol cartridge, and fill capsule.

IMPORTANT: the cartridge/fill capsule/wicks are interchangeable between
8020/8020A/8020M. However the 803X/804X cartridges/capsules/wicks are of a
different size, and are not compatible.

**Essential, but replaceable:**

* Zero Check filter. Only one is needed, most machines come with two. A
  replacement pack (2 filters) is available for around GBP 40.
* Twin tubing. The official replacement is expensive, can be DIY'd with
  "Tygon S3 E-3603, 3.2x6.4mm" instead (manufacturer uses Imperial: 1/8" ID /
  1/4" OD / 1/16" wall.
* Power supply: a USB->DC 5525 cable will do (cheaply available on Aliexpress or
  similar...). Beware of USB-**C**->DC 5525 cables, they are typically
  configured to supply higher voltages (not 5V), although some are OK (e.g. some
  models from Adafruit are correctly specified).

> [!NOTE]
> Using the PlusLife USB power cable is not a good idea (TM). It appears
> to be DC 5521 with a lot of tolerance - it will fit, but you will deform the
> PortaCount's power socket (the original power cable will no longer grip well -
> this can be fixed, but it's annoying).

**Consumables:**

* IPA (>= 99.5%).
* Probes, and Probe Installer (see below).

**Also useful:**

* Ultrasonic humidifer - aka particle generator. Useful for reproducable
  results. A fan is also helpful to ensure adequate mixing.
* Compressed **filtered** air - for cleaning etc. Currently using:
  https://www.chemtronicseu.com/typhoon-blast-70-duster
* Serial adapter (see below for instructions on how to make one).

## Additional checks

TSI's manuals already specify the standard checks, namely:

* Particle check.
* Zero check.
* Max Fit Factor check.

Additionally, the minimum-fit-factor check can catch some issues (switching
valve, clogging?):

1. Remove Zero Check filter.
2. Start fit test.
3. Verify that fit factor is approximately 1.0.

(This check also be used to verify attentuation caused by condensation in the
 sample tube.)

## Probe Installers

* [TSI 8025-N95 including PortaPunch](https://tsi.com/product-accessories/fit-test-probe-kit-for-disposable-facepieces/),
  a.k.a. the stapler (is cheapest to obtain as part of a package including 500
  probes... i.e. not cheap, but the safest option - it can also be obtained
  separately, for a very similar price.).
   * There is also an older discontinued TSI piercing tool which doesn't look
     very safe, [photos on p. 2
     here](https://www.kenelec.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/TSI-8025-N95-Fit-Test-Probe-Kit-SpecSheet.pdf).
     8095s often come with this installer.
* [Lucentia 3D printed punch](https://www.printables.com/model/844832-diy-portacount-punch?lang=de):
  used in conjunction with a Draper Awl, this is probably the most cost
  effective option.
* [Fit Test The Planet's probe installer](https://x.com/FitTestMyPlanet/status/1672785898944049154):
  nice design, requires advanced maker skills.
* [AccuPunch](https://accutec.com/product/accupunch-fit-test-probing-tool-patent-pending/):
  wow, this is expensive.
* MaskNerd's probe installer.

## Probes

### Single-Use

* TSI probes, TSI 8025-N95 (includes probe installer and case, see
  above), or TSI 8025-N95R (probes only). Expensive, but they work.
* [Accutec Probes](https://accutec.com/product/disposable-respirator-fit-testing-probes-500ea/):
  might be cheaper than TSI probes in some regions.
* Nukit probes.

### Reusable/DIY

* [Noms780 single-sided barb](https://x.com/noms780/status/1842417095033921771).
* [Antiviral Marketing dual-sided barb](https://x.com/antiviral_mktng/status/1784682586247209013?)

### Elastomeric

* Many manufacturers sell official adapters, they're typically expensive (GVS
  excepted).
* [DIY dual-sided metal barb fitting in combination with the ubiquitous pancake
  filters](https://x.com/GrumpyParticle/status/1822502508482252901) (equivalent
  plastic barb fittings do exist, and might be a better idea - see links above).
  This approach should work with most elastomerics that have a pancake filter
  option? (Note: the tube on the inside is important to avoid sampling only
  filtered air.)

### Of special note

* Sibata "Test Guide" [080200-085](https://www.sibata.co.jp/en/item/080200-085/)
  and [080200-0851 (Disposable?)](https://www.sibata.co.jp/en/item/080200-0851/).
  These go between mask and face (risk of causing additional leakage?), and
  appear to be designed for testing directly prior to exposure.

## Serial Adapters

> [!NOTE]: 8020Mgen2s do not require an adapter - just use a standard
> USB-A->USB-B cable. These devices do have a serial port, but it may use a
> different pinout (the FitPro instructions state that the "data port" should
> not be used for these machines) - I have not tested myself.

Options:

* First-party TSI adapter. These are rare (some ebay listings include them).
* DIY suggestion 1: USB->RS-232 DB9 adapter, and make your own serial converter.
* DIY suggestion 2: USB->RS-232 RJ45 cable, and crimp your own RJ45 with the
  correct mapping.
* DIY suggestion 3: USB->RS-232 DB9 adapter, "modular" DB9 to RJ45 converter, and
  a short patch cable.
  * E.g. the Startech [DB9 to RJ45 converter (GC98ff)
    ](https://www.startech.com/de-ch/kabel/gc98ff).
  * Or a [similar thing on Aliexpress
    ](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32998825926.html)

I've only attempted the first DIY option - see instructions below. Option 3 seems
like the easiest.

> [!IMPORTANT]: TSI does not follow standard pin numbering. Be sure to
> cross-check your wiring against the diagrams on pp. 10-11 of the Technical
> Addendum.

### DIY Serial Converter (Option 1)

Parts needed:

* USB->RS-232 with DB9 cable. I've used both a generic FT-232RL cable, and an
  Aten UC232A1. (If your computer has a serial port, you can skip this.)
* Some scrap Ethernet cable. My instructions assume T568B termination (most
   cables), if you use T568A instead then the mapping below will be incorrect.
* DB-9 connector - I've used [one of these with screw
  terminals](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006812458316.html),
  but there's not much between different products. Make sure to get one of the
  appropriate gender for your USB->RS-232 cable.

1. Cut an appropriate length of ethernet cable.
1. Connect the wires to your DB-9 using the following mapping:

| Pin | Colour            |
| :-- | :---------------- |
| `1` | Brown             |
| `2` | Blue              |
| `3` | Green             |
| `4` | Orange striped    |
| `5` | Orange            |
| `6` | Brown striped     |
| `7` | _(not connected)_ |
| `8` | Brown striped     |
| `9` | Green striped     |

Note: pg. 10 of the Addendum indicates that pins mapping to 1+9 here (DCD+RI)
are unused, however pg. 11 shows them as being connected. I followed the pg.
11 mapping. I can't imagine that it matters in practice, but connecting all
wires is more aesthetically pleasing.
