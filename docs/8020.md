# 8020 / 8020A / 8020M stuff

## Components

(See also the Operation and Service Manual, below, it lists most of this stuff.
 There is also a list of suppliers at the bottom of this page.)

**Essentials, hard to find elsewhere:**

* The machine, including dust cap.
* Alcohol cartridge, and fill capsule.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cartridge/fill capsule/wicks are interchangeable between 8020/8020A/8020M.
> However 803X/804X cartridges/capsules/wicks are of a different size, and are
> not compatible.

**Essential, but replaceable:**

* Zero Check filter. Only one is needed, most machines come with two. See below
  for replacements.
* Twin tubing. The official replacement is expensive, can be DIY'd with
  "Tygon S3 E-3603, 3.2x6.4mm" instead (manufacturer uses Imperial: 1/8" ID /
  1/4" OD / 1/16" wall.
* Power supply: a USB->DC 5525 cable will do (cheaply available on Aliexpress or
  similar...). Beware of USB-**C**->DC 5525 cables, they are typically
  configured to supply higher voltages (not 5V), although some are OK (e.g. some
  models from Adafruit are correctly specified).

> [!NOTE]
> Using the PlusLife USB power cable is not a good idea (TM). It appears
> to be DC 5521 with a lot of tolerance - it will fit, but you will deform the
> PortaCount's power socket (the original power cable will no longer grip well -
> this can be fixed, but it's annoying).

**Consumables:**

* IPA (>= 99.5%).
* Probes, and Probe Installer (see below).

**Also useful:**

* Compressed **filtered** air - for cleaning etc. Currently using:
  https://www.chemtronicseu.com/typhoon-blast-70-duster
* Serial adapter (see below for instructions on how to make one).
* Ultrasonic humidifer - aka particle generator. Useful for reproducable
  results. A fan is also helpful to ensure adequate mixing.
* High power air purifier. If you want truly reproducable results, you'll want
  to remove all ambient particles first, and then reinject your
  consistently-sized particles using your humidifer (see previous item, and
  note below).

> [!NOTE]
> High ambient particle counts (e.g. > 5k) are entirely unnecessary. Many
> community testers aim for high particle counts, but this is based on a
> misunderstanding: a larger proportion of small particles close to MPPS
> will lead to higher measured penetration, which skews results down relative
> to peak/expected values (which testers do not like - this is a subject worthy
> of its own discussion). Outdoor air tends to have many particles closer to
> MPPS, which can lead to lower scores relative to what are considered "ideal"
> testing conditions. In houses with HVAC systems this effect is even more
> pronounced. But instead of injecting a large number of generated particles,
> you can achieve the same effect by removing almost all ambient particles
> **first**, followed by injecting a small number of generated particles.
> The author typically tests under such conditions, with ambient particle
> concentrations around 1.5-2k, while achieving peak scores similar to those
> demonstrated by other testers under ambient concentraitons close to 10k.

## Additional checks

TSI's manuals already specify the standard checks, namely:

* Particle check.
* Zero check.
* Max Fit Factor check.

Additionally, the minimum-fit-factor check can catch some issues (switching
valve, clogging?):

1. Remove Zero Check filter.
2. Start fit test.
3. Verify that fit factor is approximately 1.0.

(This check also be used to verify attentuation caused by condensation in the
 sample tube.)

## Probe Installers

* [TSI 8025-N95 including PortaPunch](https://tsi.com/product-accessories/fit-test-probe-kit-for-disposable-facepieces/),
  a.k.a. the stapler (is cheapest to obtain as part of a package including 500
  probes... i.e. not cheap, but the safest option - it can also be obtained
  separately, for a very similar price.).
   * There is also an older discontinued TSI piercing tool which doesn't look
     very safe, [photos on p. 2
     here](https://www.kenelec.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/TSI-8025-N95-Fit-Test-Probe-Kit-SpecSheet.pdf).
     8095s often come with this installer. (See warning below.)
> [!WARNING]
> This older TSI piercing tool is not compatible with *recent* TSI probes (TSI
> 8025-N95 or 8025-N95R) - these probes can get stuck on the tool, and it's
> difficult remove them again without potentially breaking the tool - cue
> disappointed testers (best case you'll be able to reassemble the tool,
> but it won't work very well - not that it worked very well in the first
> place).
* [Lucentia 3D printed punch](https://www.printables.com/model/844832-diy-portacount-punch?lang=de):
  used in conjunction with a Draper Awl, this is probably the most cost
  effective option.
* [Fit Test The Planet's probe installer](https://x.com/FitTestMyPlanet/status/1672785898944049154):
  nice design, requires advanced maker skills.
* [AccuPunch](https://accutec.com/product/accupunch-fit-test-probing-tool-patent-pending/):
  wow, this is expensive. The
  [manual](https://accutec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AccuPUNCH-Assembly-and-User-Manual.pdf)
  is also interesting if you are curious to see just how over-engineered it is.
* MaskNerd's probe installer.

## Probes

### Single-Use

* TSI probes, TSI 8025-N95 (includes probe installer and case, see
  above), or TSI 8025-N95R (probes only). Expensive, but they work.
* [Accutec Probes](https://accutec.com/product/disposable-respirator-fit-testing-probes-500ea/):
  might be cheaper than TSI probes in some regions.
* Nukit probes.

> [!NOTE]
> Probe weights - useful if you need to split a pack and don't want to count
> individual probes:
> * TSI (from an 8025-N95 pack purchased in 2024):
>     * Probe: 0.284g/probe (20=5.7g, 30=8.4g, 40=11.3g, 50=14.2g - and my
>       scales aren't the best).
>     * Nut: 0.184g/probe (20=3.7g, 30=5.5g, 40=7.4g, 50=9.2g).

### Reusable/DIY

* [Noms780 single-sided barb](https://x.com/noms780/status/1842417095033921771).
* [Antiviral Marketing dual-sided barb](https://x.com/antiviral_mktng/status/1784682586247209013?)

### Elastomeric

* Many manufacturers sell official adapters, they're typically expensive (GVS
  excepted).
* [DIY dual-sided metal barb fitting in combination with the ubiquitous pancake
  filters](https://x.com/GrumpyParticle/status/1822502508482252901) (equivalent
  plastic barb fittings do exist, and might be a better idea - see links above).
  This approach should work with most elastomerics that have a pancake filter
  option? (Note: the tube on the inside is important to avoid sampling only
  filtered air.)

### Of special note

* Sibata "Test Guide" [080200-085](https://www.sibata.co.jp/en/item/080200-085/)
  and [080200-0851 (Disposable?)](https://www.sibata.co.jp/en/item/080200-0851/).
  These go between mask and face (risk of causing additional leakage?), and
  appear to be designed for testing directly prior to exposure.

## Serial Adapters

> [!NOTE]
> 8020Mgen2s do not require an adapter - just use a standard
> USB-A->USB-B cable. These devices do have a serial port, but it may use a
> different pinout (the FitPro instructions state that the "data port" should
> not be used for these machines) - I have not tested myself.

Options:

* First-party TSI adapter. These are rare (some ebay listings include them).
* DIY suggestion 1: USB->RS-232 DB9 adapter, and make your own serial converter.
* DIY suggestion 2: USB->RS-232 RJ45 cable, and crimp your own RJ45 with the
  correct mapping.
* DIY suggestion 3: USB->RS-232 DB9 adapter, "modular" DB9 to RJ45 converter, and
  a short patch cable.
  * E.g. the Startech [DB9 to RJ45 converter (GC98ff)
    ](https://www.startech.com/de-ch/kabel/gc98ff).
  * Or a [similar thing on Aliexpress
    ](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32998825926.html)

I have only attempted Options 1 and 3, which are detailed below. Option 3 is
entirely tool-free, but IMHO fiddlier than Option 1.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TSI does not follow standard pin numbering. Be sure to cross-check your wiring
> against the diagrams on pp. 10-11 of the Technical Addendum.

### DIY Serial Converter (Option 1)

Parts needed:

* USB->RS-232 with DB9 cable. I've used both a generic FT-232RL cable, and an
  Aten UC232A1. (If your computer has a serial port, you can skip this.)
* Some scrap Ethernet cable. My instructions assume T568B termination (most
   cables), if you use T568A instead then the mapping below will be incorrect.
* DB-9 connector - I've used [one of these with screw
  terminals](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006812458316.html),
  but there's not much between different products. Make sure to get one of the
  appropriate gender for your USB->RS-232 cable.

1. Cut an appropriate length of ethernet cable.
1. Connect the wires to your DB-9 using the following mapping:

| Pin | Colour            |
| :-- | :---------------- |
| `1` | Brown             |
| `2` | Blue              |
| `3` | Green             |
| `4` | Orange striped    |
| `5` | Orange            |
| `6` | Brown striped     |
| `7` | _(not connected)_ |
| `8` | Blue striped      |
| `9` | Green striped     |

Note: pg. 10 of the Addendum indicates that pins mapping to 1+9 here (DCD+RI)
are unused, however pg. 11 shows them as being connected. I followed the pg.
11 mapping. I can't imagine that it matters in practice, but connecting all
wires is more aesthetically pleasing.

### DIY Serial Converter (Option 3)

Parts needed:
* USB->RS-232 with DB9 cable (same as above).
* A length of ethernet cable, I bought a 10cm cable.
* "Modular" DB9 to RJ45 converter (see above). I bought a male + female pair
  from Aliexpress.

I used the following mapping, which is based on [Startech's
diagram](https://sgcdn.startech.com/005329/media/sets/GC98FF/Diagram/GC98FF_Diagram.PDF),
however I've only actually tested it with the Aliexpress adapters (where brown
appears to have been swapped for grey).


| Pin | Colour            |
| :-- | :---------------- |
| `1` | White             |
| `2` | Red               |
| `3` | Yellow            |
| `4` | Blue              |
| `5` | Orange            |
| `6` | Brown (or grey)   |
| `7` | _(not connected)_ |
| `8` | Green             |
| `9` | Black             |

## Disassembly/tools

Tools:

* 7/64" allen key (cries in metric).

## Cables and tubes

* Power supply: DC 5.5/2.5mm barrel jack, 5V.
* Twin tubing (see dimensions above - "Tygon"): new tubing produced 2020:
  158/152cm, tubes with used machines: 150/145cm 144/141cm.
* N95 companion tubing/cables:
    * Interconnect (8020->8028): 10.5cm

        * Tube (including fitted moisture trap): 121cm
	* Cable: male-male 3.5mm 2-contact (or mono) jack plug: 116cm excluding plugs
	  (it's slightly longer than the tube when accounting for plugs).
    * Pendant->subject twin tubing: 44/39.5cm

* Zero-Check/HEPA filters (can also be DIY'd, apparently):
    * Item 801625: this looks like the old style that came with 8020(A)s?, e.g.
      https://www.face-fit.co.uk/product/zero-filter-2/ .
    * Item 803X-ZFLTR: the new style that came with 803X and newer, 8020Mgen2,
      etc.:
      https://www.frontline-safety.co.uk/tsi-zero-check-filter-hepa-for-portacount
    * ETA Filters HC03-5N-B looks like the OEM version of the 803X-ZFLTR (you
      will need your own tubing + connector):
      https://etafilters.com/products/hc03-5n-b-zero-count-filter
    * Balston 933-05-AQ (99.9999% at 0.01um) and 933-05-AAQ (99.99999% at 0.01
      um) also appear to have the appropriate specs, and I have encountered at
      least one 8020 delivered with a Balston BQ grade filter (99.99% at 0.01u).
