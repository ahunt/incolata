# 8020 / 8020A / 8020M stuff

## Components

(See also the Operation and Service Manual, below, it lists most of this stuff.
 There is also a list of suppliers at the bottom of this page.)

**Essentials, hard to find elsewhere:**

* The machine, including dust cap.
* Alcohol cartridge, and fill capsule.

IMPORTANT: the cartridge/fill capsule/wicks are interchangeable between
8020/8020A/8020M. However the 803X/804X cartridges/capsules/wicks are of a
different size, and are not compatible.

**Essential, but replaceable:**

* Zero Check filter. Only one is needed, most machines come with two. A
  replacement pack (2 filters) is available for around GBP 40.
* Twin tubing. The official replacement is expensive, can be DIY'd with
  "Tygon S3 E-3603, 3.2x6.4mm" instead (manufacturer uses Imperial: 1/8" ID /
  1/4" OD / 1/16" wall.
* Power supply: a USB->DC 5525 cable will do (cheaply available on Aliexpress or
  similar...). Beware of USB-**C**->DC 5525 cables, they are typically
  configured to supply higher voltages (not 5V), although some (e.g. some models
  from Adafruit are correctly specified).

  NOTE: using the PlusLife USB power cable is not a good idea (TM). It appears
  to be DC 5521 with a lot of tolerance - it will fit, but you will deform the
  PortaCount's power socket (the original power cable will no longer grip well -
  this can be fixed, but it's annoying).

**Consumables:**

* IPA (>= 99.5%).
* Probes, and Probe Installer (see below).

**Also useful:**

* Ultrasonic humidifer - aka particle generator. Useful for reproducable
  results. A fan is also helpful to ensure adequate mixing.
* Compressed **filtered** air - for cleaning etc. Currently using:
  https://www.chemtronicseu.com/typhoon-blast-70-duster
* Serial adapter.

TODO: add instructions on how to make an adapter.

IMPORTANT: TSI does not follow standard pin numbering. Be sure to cross-check
your wiring against the diagrams on pp. 10-11 of the Technical Addendum.

## Additional checks

TSI's manuals already specify the standard checks, namely:

* Particle check.
* Zero check.
* Max Fit Factor check.

Additionally, the minimum-fit-factor check can catch some issues (switching
valve, clogging?):

1. Remove Zero Check filter.
2. Start fit test.
3. Verify that fit factor is approximately 1.0.

(This check also be used to verify attentuation caused by condensation in the
 sample tube.)

## Probe Installers

* [TSI 8025-N95 including PortaPunch](https://tsi.com/product-accessories/fit-test-probe-kit-for-disposable-facepieces/),
  a.k.a. the stapler (is cheapest to obtain as part of a package including 500
  probes... i.e. not cheap, but the safest option - it can also be obtained
  separately, for a very similar price.).
   * There is also an older discontinued TSI piercing tool which doesn't look
     very safe, [photos on p. 2
     here](https://www.kenelec.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/TSI-8025-N95-Fit-Test-Probe-Kit-SpecSheet.pdf).
* [Lucentia 3D printed punch](https://www.printables.com/model/844832-diy-portacount-punch?lang=de):
  used in conjunction with a Draper Awl, this is probably the most cost
  effective option.
* [Fit Test The Planet's probe installer](https://x.com/FitTestMyPlanet/status/1672785898944049154):
  nice design, requires advanced maker skills.
* [AccuPunch](https://accutec.com/product/accupunch-fit-test-probing-tool-patent-pending/):
  wow, this is expensive.
* MaskNerd's probe installer.

## Probes

### Single-Use

* TSI probes, TSI 8025-N95 (includes probe installer and case, see
  above), or TSI 8025-N95R (probes only). Expensive, but they work.
* [Accutec Probes](https://accutec.com/product/disposable-respirator-fit-testing-probes-500ea/):
  might be cheaper than TSI probes in some regions.
* Nukit probes.

### Reusable/DIY

* [Noms780 single-sided barb](https://x.com/noms780/status/1842417095033921771).
* [Antiviral Marketing dual-sided barb](https://x.com/antiviral_mktng/status/1784682586247209013?)

### Elastomeric

* Many manufacturers sell official adapters, they're typically expensive (GVS
  excepted).
* [DIY dual-sided metal barb fitting in combination with the ubiquitous pancake
  filters](https://x.com/GrumpyParticle/status/1822502508482252901) (equivalent
  plastic barb fittings do exist, and might be a better idea - see links above).
  This approach should work with most elastomerics that have a pancake filter
  option? (Note: the tube on the inside is important to avoid sampling only
  filtered air.)

### Of special note

* Sibata "Test Guide" [080200-085](https://www.sibata.co.jp/en/item/080200-085/)
  and [080200-0851 (Disposable?)](https://www.sibata.co.jp/en/item/080200-0851/).
  These go between mask and face (risk of causing additional leakage?), and
  appear to be designed for testing directly prior to exposure.

  * Unfortunately this analysis doesn't touch on the topic of diffusion (if
    any).
