    * This study investigated SWPF for surgical masks, N95, and elastomeric
      half-masks, with and without fit-testing.
    * OSHA does not consider this approach to qualify as an actual SWPF study,
      but the results obtained for fit-tested devices in this study do match
      the data used by OSHA during their APF rulemaking
      (https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/federalregister/2006-08-24).
    * Shows clear benefit - 6x improvement in SWPF for disposable respirators
      (EHMR results are complex, and it's too delicate a topic to discuss here).

    * "Subjects performed exercises similar to those used during fit testing"
    * "A helmet with a copper tubing frame is used to fix the sampling line in a
       stable position to minimize face seal leaks due to the movement of the
       person wearing the sampling setup." (taken from ref Lee et al., 2008).
    * "In addition, the average PFs increased by 1.4-fold after the
      subject–respirator combinations that failed fit testing were excluded"

      from: Colton, C. E.: Filtering facepieces: Study supports need for
      fit-testing. 3M JobHealth Highlights 17(2):1-4 (1999) (unfortunately I was
      unable to figure out how to access this).

  (QLFT) Also supports approx 5-6x improvement in P95 protection, but is not a
  (S)WPF study - in fact it's not even a full fit test.

## Correlation of fit factors and WPFs

Correlation has only been found in studies where respirators were not re-donned,
and it was weak (stronger for QNFT fails i.e. FF < 100).

* Zhuang Z, Coffey CC, Jensen PA, Campbell DL, Lawrence RB, Myers WR. Correlation between
  quantitative fit factors and workplace protection factors measured in actual
  workplace environments at a steel foundry. AIHA J (Fairfax, Va). 2003
  Nov-Dec;64(6):730-8. doi: 10.1202/475.1. PMID: 14674806.
    * Did find weak correlation, but:
    * "might not be decisive enough to conclude that FFs were reliable (i.e.,
      ‘‘meaningful’’) predictors of workplace performance (i.e., 45% of
      variability was unexplained). "
    * "Another reason this study found significant correlation between WPFs and
      FFs was that WPF samples were collected without re-donning of the
      respirators."
    * "Thus, these results should not be taken to indicate that a measured FF
      will be predictive of subsequent WPFs after the respirator has been
      redonned. In that case the variation introduced by redonning must be taken
      into consideration."

    * Includes non-passing respirators, correlation is weak, very little data
      for passing respirators which is noisy - Figure 3, Page 6.

    * Does show correlation, but...
    * SWPF study, with no redon between fit test and exercises. The fit test was
      abbreviated/modified, but this might not matter.
    * 1 model of respirator, 15 subjects. Perhaps only some respirators maintain
      protection between fit-test and real-world usage (if yes: which models?).
    * Measurement was performed with the wearer attached to the Portacount, in a
      small test chamber. I expect that this would result in reduced movement vs
      real-world - OTOH the CPR exercise should generate a lot of movement?

    * SWPF with limitations.
    * Not clear whether any redonning was involved.
    * Shows correlation below FF 100, but above that is more noise than signal.

## Leakage (vs filter grade)

* Chen CC, Willeke K. Characteristics of face seal leakage in filtering
  facepieces. Am Ind Hyg Assoc J. 1992 Sep;53(9):533-9. doi:
  10.1080/15298669291360120. PMID: 1524028.
  "If there is substantial lack of face seal fit and the wearer performs a light
   workload (low breathing rate), a HEPA respirator may provide less protecton
   than a DM respirator. This may occur because the high pressure across the
   HEPA filter pulls a greater amount of aerosols through a leak of given size
   than the much lower pressure drop across the dust-mist respirator."
