# General notes on fit-testing

## Impact of fit-testing

  three different types of respiratory protection devices. J Occup Environ Hyg.
  2006 Sep;3(9):465-74. doi: 10.1080/15459620600829211. PMID: 16857645.
   * This study investigated SWPF for surgical masks, N95, and elastomeric
     half-masks, with and without fit-testing.
   * OSHA does not consider this approach to qualify as an actual SWPF study,
     but the results obtained for fit-tested devices in this study do match
     the data used by OSHA during their APF rulemaking
     (https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/federalregister/2006-08-24).

     from: Colton, C. E.: Filtering facepieces: Study supports need for
     fit-testing. 3M JobHealth Highlights 17(2):1-4 (1999) (unfortunately I was
     unable to figure out how to access this).

## Correlation of fit factors and WPFs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section is very much a work in progress.

Spoiler alert: possibly none whatsoever.

  quantitative fit factors and workplace protection factors measured in actual
  workplace environments at a steel foundry. AIHA J (Fairfax, Va). 2003
